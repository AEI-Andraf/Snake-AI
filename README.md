# Snake-AI
Deep Q-Learning agent trained to play Snake using a custom game state and extended neural network architecture.

Reinforcement learning agent trained with Deep Q-Learning to play Snake.  
State space includes geometric and directional features.  
Neural network is a multi-layer perceptron with increased depth and capacity.  
Training includes experience replay, epsilon decay, and reward shaping.  
Implemented in PyTorch. Environment: custom Pygame loop.
